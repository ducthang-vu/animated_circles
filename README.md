# ANIMATED CIRCLES
ANIMATED CIRCLES is a simple and interactive canvas built with HTML, CSS, and (vanilla) JavaScript.

Have a look on [codepen](https://codepen.io/ducthang-vu/pen/XWmpwBO).


## FEATURES
On page load, 600 circles will be spawned. They will be moving at a random yet constant speed.

Move the mouse inside the page: circles close to the cursor will grow.
They will revert to their original size once far from the cursor.

By double-clicking inside the page you will activate the "attraction" feature.
Double-click again to disable it.
